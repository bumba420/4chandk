# Maintainer needed #

**This project is unmaintained. The code it good and it works, but is incomplete. If you would like to take over please contact me!** (contact me at bottiger@gmail.com)

== The old introduction

The board which will replace Trevorchan-board on 4chan.dk. It isn't, and probably won't ever be, as featurerich as Trevorchan, but it will be awesome because:

  * the code will shine (compared to 'other' scripts)
  * it will be bugfree(TM)
  * secure (yeah right, but I'm doing my best)
  * easy to maintain/extend.
  * Released under a 'do want you want' BSD-style licens.
  * Works with safe mode on.

However:

  * It will require you to run at least PHP5.
  * It will _proberbly_ require you to run MySQL 5.
  * I don't think I'll be very fast (though it will have some nifty cacheing-options)

I'm only working on this in my sparetime (i.e. not very much), so don't expect a stable release before summer 2007.
